# 🛒 E-commerce Customer Behavior Analytics Platform

This project simulates real-time clickstream events, processes large-scale data streams, and extracts actionable insights for business optimization. It is designed to be scalable using AWS services such as Glue, Redshift, and Kafka, with a local Jupyter Notebook simulation for demonstration purposes.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

A modern data pipeline that ingests e-commerce clickstream data, performs cleaning and transformation, and enables cloud-based storage and analysis. This project demonstrates data ingestion, ETL, business insights extraction, and dashboard visualization.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Random)
- Kafka (simulated event streaming)
- AWS Glue (planned for large-scale ETL)
- AWS Redshift (planned data warehousing)
- Apache Airflow (planned orchestration)
- Looker (planned visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (local simulation)

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview (Simulation)

```
User Clickstream ➔ Kafka ➔ S3 (Raw Data) ➔ AWS Glue ETL ➔ Redshift ➔ Looker Dashboards
```

> In this project, the pipeline is demonstrated using lightweight in-memory simulations via Pandas.

## ⚡ Scalability Note

This notebook demonstrates a local simulation. For real production environments processing millions of records, this architecture is designed to scale using:
- Kafka for real-time ingestion
- AWS Glue for distributed ETL
- Amazon Redshift for storage and querying
- Apache Airflow for orchestration
- Looker/Tableau for dashboards
